### This repo contains my solutions for the daily problems provided by Advent Of Code
#### **Spoiler Alert: this contains solutions to the problems**

- I used Javascript to solve all of the problems
- I used the dev tools within the input page to get the data and reformat/organize it into the format that I wanted
- I used Repl to solve the problems, which can be seen here: [John Adams Repl](https://repl.it/@Jadams813)
